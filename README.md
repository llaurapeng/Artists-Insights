I created an app to gain insights into Spotify artists. You can search an artist in the search bar and my app will output the popularity of the artist, followers, a visualization of song attributes 
for their top 10 songs, how loud the songs are, and how popular each song is. It will also 
show you the top 20 related artists and how their popularity score differs from the current
artist you're looking at. I also web scrapped off of wiki to provide information on the awards
the artist has won, what television and films they have been in, and details about their career.
